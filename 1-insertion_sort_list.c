* insertion_sort_list - sorts a doubly linked list of integers
* @list: Linked list
* Return: Nothing, this function is (void)
* Write a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers
* in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm
* Prototype: void insertion_sort_list(listint_t **list);
* You are not allowed to modify the integer n of a node.
* You have to swap the nodes themselves.
* Youâ€™re expected to print the list after each time you swap two elements
* Write in the file 1-O, the big O notations of the time complexity
* of the Insertion sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:
* in the best case
* in the average case
* in the worst case
